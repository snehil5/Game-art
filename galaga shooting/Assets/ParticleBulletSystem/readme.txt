The role of this asset is to shoot bullets and cause an explosion.
And run it on a low-performance personal computer.
If you do Demo 2 and Demo 3 of Example File, you will understand what this asset is.



ParticlePaster may be deleted or there may be a big change in specification in the future.
It is because of its heavy operation and limited use.

I noticed that source code and variable names are strange.
However, it is difficult to replace.
It is inconvenient that the variable name changes every time upgrading.
I left this problem.
